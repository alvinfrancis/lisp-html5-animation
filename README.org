* HTML5 Animation with Lisp

  This is a an abandoned project trying to implement of [[http://lamberta.github.io/html5-animation/][Foundation
  HTML5 Animation with Javascript]] using pure Common Lisp.  In
  particular, this was attempted to test viability of parenscript
  while learning basic animation in HTML5.

  Used Common Lisp dependencies are:

  - restas (Web Framework)
  - sexml (HTML templating)
  - parenscript (Common Lisp subset to Javascript compiler)
